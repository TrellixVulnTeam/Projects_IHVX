		<p>The film Walk The Line stars Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon. It is a movie that documents the life of the remarkable Johnny Cash. From adolescene to adulthood, the audience witnesses the hardships and decisions of the real-life singer. The movie is a classic; the actors perform wonderfully as they portray Johnny Cash (Phoenix) and June Carter (Witherspoon). None of the singing in the movie is from the originals (the Cash's), but instead, Witherspoon and Phoenix took on the task of mimicing the classic voices impeccably.</p>

		<p>Reese Witherspoon as been a household name as long as I can remember. She has starred in dozens of movies--ranging from a cutesy chick-flick to the 1990's horror film "Fear." In addition, she played opposite Jaoquin Phoenix in Walk The Line. To this day, she has maintained as good name for herself. She has her own clothing line, raises her children, and continues to star in films and various television series. Her next film, A Wrinkle in Time, will premeire next year (2018).</p>
