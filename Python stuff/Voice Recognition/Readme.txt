This is a (very) short program I wrote to test Google's API.

Long-term goal is to create a program that will allow me to interact with my raspberry pi
via voice-recognition to allow me to:

1. Load youtube videos, spotify, play music, etc.
2. Allow me to interact with my server without going downstairs/being at home.
3. Let me check my investment portfolio and have it displayed in my wall-mounted monitor.
