Brainstorming how to do pathfinding...

Get enemy sprite's rect and see what direction it needs to go.  

After the direction is picked, launch an invisible sprite with the same hitbox in that direction.

In the instance of a collision, navigate it like a maze, however, launch into two directions:
	For the left direction, attempt to go to the right as often as possible
	For the right direction, attempt to go to the right as often as possible
	Once a suitable path is found, look for shortcuts.

How to find shortcuts will be a different matter.
